# When X is univariate, bimodality is a necessary but not sufficient condition to support 
# the hypothesis that a sample of morhpological measurements represents two species
#	1) pick an a priori frequency cutoff below which overlap is rare enough to suggest
#		evolutionary isolation. Say 95% CI that 90% of hypothesized species don't overlap
